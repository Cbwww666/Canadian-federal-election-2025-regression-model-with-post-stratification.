# Canadian-federal-election-2025-regression-model-with-post-stratification.
To predict the overall popular vote of the next Canadian federal election (tentatively 2025) using a regression model with post-stratification.

## Objective
To predict the overall popular vote of the next Canadian federal election (tentatively 2025) using a regression model with post-stratification.
Please note that there is NO requirement on the type of model you use. You can use a standard model (i.e., simple or multiple regression), a multilevel model or a Bayesian model (standard or multilevel). The model choice is up to you. With that being said, the model should still be appropriate (e.g., logistic regression for binary outcome, or if you assume a prior distribution you should justify the prior in some way).

## General Social Survey (GSS) - Census Data
You will need to grab the GSS data from the CHASS website (I cannot post it for copyright/privacy reasons). Instructions for how to access and load in this data are available in the first 30 lines of the gss_cleaning.R code. Additionally, the gss_cleaning.R document has code that I used to clean the data. You do NOT need to describe the cleaning included in this R script in your report, you only need to describe any additional cleaning that YOUR GROUP had done.

## CES - Survey Data
Here is a resource for grabbing the CES2019 data: https://awstringer1.github.io/sta238-book/section-short- tutorial-on-pulling-data-for-assignment-1.html#section-canadian-election-study. There is some code avail- able in the Assignment3.Rmd where I go through selecting and grabbing the CES2019phone data set.
Additionally, Paul and Rohan have some more documentation here https://hodgettsp.github.io/cesR/ that you may find useful.
